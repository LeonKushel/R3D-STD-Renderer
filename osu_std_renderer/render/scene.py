"""Object lifecycle + per-frame scene draw — the Phase-1 "first moving
render" pass.

RENDER_PLAN.md semantics implemented here:
  §2.5 circle fades   — fade-in over TimeFadeIn from startTime-Preempt,
                        full until the hit, then the hit-explosion: alpha
                        1→0 and scale 1→1.4 over HitFadeOut=240 ms (skin
                        v2+ shape). Combo number does the v2+ quick 60 ms
                        fade instead of scaling with the explosion.
  §2.5 approach       — ring scales 4→1 over [startTime-Preempt,
                        startTime], combo-coloured, alpha capped at 0.9,
                        gone at the hit.
  §5.3 draw order     — objects iterate REVERSED (newest under oldest);
                        a slider's body under its own end circle / ball /
                        head; approach circles on a top layer; cursor on
                        top of everything.
  §4.9 Snaking.In     — body grows over the first third of the preempt
                        (lazer SnakingSliderBody timing); the tail circle
                        rides the snake tip.

JUDGMENT PHASE (ruleset/ruleset.py drives this; pass judgments=SimResult):
  * explosions fire at the REAL hit time (click delta), not startTime;
    a missed circle/slider-head never explodes — it quick-fades out at
    its window close (stable's brief red-tint variant is SKIPPED — plain
    fade; noted per the plan).
  * judgment popups: procedural 300/100/50 numbers + red miss X at the
    object's popup position, ResultFadeIn=120 / ResultFadeOut=600 (§2.4);
    300 popups draw fainter so a clean run doesn't strobe.
  * sliderbreaks read as the ball detaching: the follow ball dims while
    the ruleset says tracking was lost (and there is no tail explosion —
    the phase-1 body fade already has none).
  * without a replay/judgments (--dump-frames debug, future --no-replay)
    every object falls back to the Phase-1 "perfect hit at startTime".

BACKGROUND + DIM PHASE (§4.10, render/background.py): the map background
draws FIRST (under everything), aspect-filled to the frame, tinted grey
by 1 - DimEnvelope.level(t) so only the background dims. No bg → the
dark-void clear, unchanged.

SKIN PHASE (render/skin_elements.py): when a SkinElements is attached,
each core element the skin provides replaces its procedural stand-in —
hitcircle (combo-tinted) + hitcircleoverlay (untinted, above the circle,
under the number unless HitCircleOverlayAboveNumber), approachcircle
(tinted), HitCirclePrefix combo digits (HitCircleOverlap layout), sliderb
(tint per AllowSliderBallTint/SliderBall), sliderfollowcircle (2.4× while
tracking), skin.ini SliderBorder/SliderTrackOverride body colours, skin
cursor/trail/middle (behind --skin-cursor, CursorCentre honored), hit0/
50/100/300 judgment sprites (a fully-transparent skin texture = draw
NOTHING — the classic empty hit300). Elements the skin lacks fall back
per-element to the procedural set (the §3.1 LOCAL source).

ARROWS + TICKS + FOLLOW POINTS PHASE (render/markers.py holds the pure
schedule/lifecycle math — see its docstring for the semantics):
  * reverse arrows on the active repeat end, rotated along the path
    tangent INTO the slider, white (never combo-tinted), beat-pulsed
    (§3.2 version gate: v<2 ±6° wobble, v2+ 1.3→1.0 scale), exploding
    on a hit repeat / vanishing on a sliderbreak.
  * slider ticks for the ACTIVE span only, snake-gated, popping when
    hit / vanishing when missed (per the ruleset's part outcomes).
  * follow points between same-combo neighbours (never spinners) on the
    lazer schedule; DrawFollowPoints honored (draw_follow_points).
  * slider heads/tails use sliderstartcircle/sliderendcircle(+overlays)
    when the skin ships them (§3.3 GetMostSpecific vs hitcircle).

CURSOR TRAIL (§3.3 two-mode rule, skin cursor only): skin HAS
cursormiddle (or ForceLongTrail) → the LONG CONNECTED trail, STRICTLY
DISTANCE-BASED (owner-directed 2026-07): the whole replay path is
resampled ONCE at init into points every LONG_TRAIL_SPACING_OSU osu!px
of cursor TRAVEL (build_distance_trail — interpolating between replay
frames, so spacing is uniform at ANY cursor speed: fast = a continuous
ribbon, never separated dots; slow = the same per-point brightness,
just a shorter ribbon — points are only emitted by MOVEMENT, so they
can never stack up and over-brighten in place). Per frame the points
inside the last LONG_TRAIL_WINDOW_MS are drawn (newest
LONG_TRAIL_MAX_POINTS≈stable's 2048 at most), each at a UNIFORM base
alpha scaled only by its age fade along the ribbon.
No cursormiddle → the classic sparse trail: one sprite dropped every
16.67 ms, each fading over TRAIL_SPRITE_LIFE_MS. The procedural (non-skin)
cursor keeps its shader-style glow trail.

SPINNER PHASE (render/spinner.py holds the pure math — see its docstring
for the lazer-legacy reference semantics):
  * §3.3 style auto-detect: skin has spinner-background → OLD style
    (background + metre bottom-up bar reveal + rotating spinner-circle);
    else new-style sprites → NEW (additive blue glow ramping with
    progress, bottom at rotation/3, top+middle2 at full rotation, middle
    fading white→red over the duration); no spinner sprites → the
    procedural Argon-ish spinner (outer ring + hub + orbiting marker +
    progress glow).
  * rotation tracks the replay cursor continuously (signed per-frame
    deltas while a key is held — the ruleset's accumulation, kept
    signed); --no-replay auto-spins at the §2.5 RPMS constant (477 RPM).
  * spinner-approachcircle shrinks 1.9→0.1 over the spin (§2.5);
    spinner-spin fades out ~0.5 s after the start; spinner-clear pops in
    when accumulated rotation meets the OD requirement; live RPM readout
    (spinner-rpm box + ScorePrefix skin digits, else HUD glyphs).
  * skin.ini SpinnerFadePlayfield dims everything under the spinner
    while it's alive; SpinnerNoBlink stills the metre's blinking bar.
  * the spinner judgment popup comes from the ruleset like every object.

HIT LIGHTING (§3.3 `lighting`): combo-tinted additive flash under each
non-miss judgment popup at its popup position, 400 ms lazer-ish
fade+expand; procedural fallback is the radial `glow` texture;
--no-hit-lighting (Gameplay.ShowHitLighting; R3D preset default ON).

SETTINGS-SURFACE PHASE (2026-07 — render/effects.py holds the pure math,
settings.py the preset mapping):
  * background: video (video_bg.py, fail-soft to image), blur-at-load,
    parallax (~1.02× sliding opposite the cursor), flash-to-beat
    brightness pulse, drifting triangles deco (dim-matched);
  * flow: real fade-to-black after the last object (audio fades with it
    in the CLI), seizure-warning card + lead-in pre-roll, the R3D "R"
    logo splash fading out exactly at the first approach;
  * §4.9: snaking OUT (snake_range — final span only, lazer semantics;
    the end cap rides the retracting tip, danser-style) and SliderMerge
    (_draw_merged_bodies → slider_body.build_merged: every visible body
    in ONE distance pass, unified colour = the oldest visible slider's,
    max alpha — accepted approximations, danser does the same);
  * cursor: trail scale, rainbow hue-cycle (procedural + skin tint),
    press-edge ripples;
  * break warning arrows (stable-style, blinking before the resume
    anchor); bloom post-pass applied AFTER cursor and BEFORE HUD (crisp
    HUD — owner call), strength pulsed to the beat when enabled.

REMAINING SIMPLIFICATIONS (each is a later-phase item):
  * slider bodies are rebuilt every frame (0.2 ms/body — fine at this
    phase; an FBO cache per static body is the known perf step).
  * skin gaps: see skin_elements.py's honest list (HUD fonts/scorebar
    stay procedural or absent; animations take frame 0 except
    sliderb/followpoint which cycle per AnimationFramerate; no cursor
    rotate/expand).
  * spinner approximations (spinner.py docstring): lazer's small
    Y-offset constants skipped (centred on the playfield centre); the
    metre blink is a deterministic 30 ms wave, not per-frame RNG;
    spinner hitsounds/bonus-spin ticks are the hitsound phase's.

The lifecycle math lives in module-level pure functions so tests need no
GL context.
