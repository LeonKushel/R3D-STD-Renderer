"""LAZER RESULTS SCREEN — the osu!(lazer) ranking screen ported to the std
renderer (owner spec 2026-07; the std default outro, R3D card behind
`results_style=r3d`).

PORTED (layout/animation semantics only — MIT, ppy/osu, no ppy assets;
every texture is procedurally baked in-repo, fonts = the bundled Nunito, our
lazer-Torus stand-in — the results screen is CLIENT UI, skin-independent, so
it uses the lazer font family, NOT the DejaVu of the skinnable gameplay HUD):

  osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/ScorePanel.cs
  osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/Expanded/ExpandedPanelMiddleContent.cs
  osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/Expanded/Accuracy/AccuracyCircle.cs
  osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/Expanded/Accuracy/GradedCircles.cs
  osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/Expanded/Accuracy/RankBadge.cs
      — ported 1:1 to the reference: the achieved-accuracy arc is the thick
        outer "Accuracy circle", a FIXED vertical CYAN→GREEN gradient
        (#7CF6FF→#BAFFA9, NOT rank-coloured), sweeping 0→acc over
        ACCURACY_TRANSFORM_DURATION with a light tip dash; behind/inside it
        the THIN GradedCircles rank ring shows the OsuColour.ForRank bands
        (D ff5a5a, C ff8e5d, B e3b130, A 88da20, S 02b5c3, X/SS de31ae) with
        the GRADE_SPACING_PERCENTAGE (2/360) notches and the SS/X band owning
        the 0.99→1.0 virtual-SS slice; six RankBadge pills sit OUTSIDE at
        their Interpolation.Lerp visual positions (rank_badge_positions), so
        they spread D→C→B→A→S→SS around the ring without piling up; the white
        centre rank letter punches in at the end of the sweep.
  osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/Expanded/StarRatingDisplay + AccuracyStatistic
  osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/Statistics/PerformanceBreakdown.cs   (bars)
  osu.Game.Rulesets.Osu/Statistics/{HitEventTimingDistribution,
      AccuracyHeatmap}.cs                                (histogram, scatter)

TWO STAGES (owner: "appear then open from screenshot 1 → 2"):
  Stage 1  the centred score panel fades in; the accuracy circle sweeps,
           the grade punches, the score rolls (RollingCounter). Settles
           and holds.
  Stage 2  the panel slides LEFT (OutQuint) while the three statistics
           panels unfold from the right, staggered — Performance
           Breakdown, Timing Distribution, Accuracy Heatmap. Held for the
           remainder of results_screen_time.

Everything is laid out in a 1080-height virtual space (uw = w / k wide,
k = h / 1080) and scaled to the frame, exactly like the HUD. Static text
and the ring base are baked once; the accuracy arc and the rolling score
re-bake only while they change (the HUD hp-bar re-upload pattern).

HONEST DEVIATIONS (documented, owner-visible):
  * no avatar source (osu!API is off-limits) → a procedural avatar keyed on
    the username (hash→hue + centred initials + ring);
  * the timing distribution tints by hit-error window (300/100/50), matching
    lazer's HitEventTimingDistributionGraph — which stacks each bin's basic
    judgments coloured via OsuColour.ForHitResult (Great→Blue 66ccff,
    Ok→Green 88b300, Meh→Yellow ffcc22). It does NOT separately tint slider
    ticks/ends: that graph FILTERS its events with
        HitObject.HitWindows != HitWindows.Empty
        && Result.IsBasic() && Result.IsHit()
    which excludes slider ticks/repeats/tails (empty hit windows, non-basic
    results) outright — and where those results DO appear elsewhere
    ForHitResult paints them Blue (66ccff, same as Great), not green. In the
    std ruleset slider ticks/ends carry no timing window, so our PartOutcome
    holds no per-tick/per-end delta to bin. The slider-tick/end tint is thus
    DEFERRED as the faithful choice (adding it would be both un-portable and
    un-lazer) — not a data gap we papered over. (osu.Game/Screens/Ranking/
    Statistics/HitEventTimingDistributionGraph.cs; OsuColour.ForHitResult.)
  * the accuracy % / max-combo / hit-result cells appear with the panel
    (only the score rolls) — the prominent RollingCounter, kept cheap.
