"""ffmpeg raw-RGB pipe — RENDER_PLAN.md §5.6 semantics on our stack; adapted
from the mania v2 encoder (OsuManiaRenderer_v2/osu_mania_renderer_v2/
encode.py: encoder probing order, rawvideo stdin input shape) simplified to
the synchronous single-process model the catch/taiko engines use.

Differences from the reference (§5.6) — deliberate:
  * ONE ffmpeg process, video on stdin + audio as a FILE input, instead of
    danser's two processes + mux step. Our audio is premixed offline
    (record/audio.py — NO BASS), so there is nothing to stream in
    lockstep; ffmpeg muxes in the same invocation.
  * Pixel path is rgb24 (renderer reads back RGB); the GPU RGB→YUV shader
    + PBO pool (§5.6 readback) is a later perf phase — mania v2's
    gpu/readback.py already proves it on this stack.
  * loudnorm (single-pass, I=-18:TP=-1.5, the 2026-07-31 audio directive)
    is applied to the audio filter chain like every in-house engine.
